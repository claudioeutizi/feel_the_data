## A machine learning-based data sonification and visualization
Map data to music and image, generating a data experience. The project is meant for anyone that is able to interact with a web app, from very young people (as it is almost usable just by looking at the images) to older ones
### Goals
* to educate the highest number of people possible: to inform the young generations and to get detached people interested in todayâ€™s issues
* make an extendible platform
*  make data understandable without having to know specific concepts
### Challenges
* Not being able to work physically together and divide the work in such a way that it could be easily merged
* Automatic music composition
* Merging together our ideas and also using the latest technologies
### Technologies
* map: p5.js, mappa.js, and the Mapbox API
* music: magenta.js, specifically the magenta RNN and magenta music VAE. We applied the valence-arousal plane concept to map the data to music
* data: OpenWeather API, specifically the Current Weather Data API and Air Pollution API
* visuals: JavaScript, the OpenAI Dall-e API, and the concepts of Particle systems and Perlin noise
The whole project is hosted in a Node.js application
